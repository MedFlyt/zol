# Zol

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MedFlyt/zol.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MedFlyt/zol)

Type safe composable SQL abstraction layer. TypeScript â†” PostgreSQL

Zol is a port to TypeScript of the excellent [Selda](https://github.com/valderman/selda)
library, which in turn was "inspired by [LINQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query)
and [Opaleye](https://github.com/tomjaguarpaw/haskell-opaleye)."

If you want to talk to a PostgreSQL database from TypeScript then you should try Zol.

Using a typesafe database access layer such as Zol will give you the same benefits that you got when you moved from JavaScript to TypeScript:

- **If it compiles it works**. The design of Zol ensures that if your code compiles then you will never get a runtime error (such as mispelling the name of a database column, or trying to compare two columns with incompatible types)

- **Amazing autocomplete**: SQL is infamous for having bad incomplete ("SELECT" is typed before "FROM"). Competing TypeScript database query builder libraries and ORMs have inferior type safety compared to Zol. Zol has full type safety, and thus full autocomplete everywhere, including the fields of database query results and intermediate results while writing query code.

- **Refactoring**: If you change the schema of a table, then the compiler will tell you about all of the queries that need to be modified to adjust to the change.

Zol is also built on the principle of composibility, meaning you can build queries out of smaller queries and sub-queries, and use these resulting queries to build even bigger queries. This is very powerful, and an essential recipe for writing [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) code. No more string concatenation of SQL query fragments or wrestling with database views.
